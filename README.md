# Linux

Linux is an operating system's kernel. You might have heard of UNIX. Well, Linux is a UNIX clone. But it was actually created by Linus Torvalds from Scratch. Linux is free and open-source, that means that you can simply change anything in Linux and redistribute it in your own name! There are several Linux Distributions, commonly called “distros”.

    * Ubuntu Linux
    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    * Linux Mint
    * Debian
    * Fedora
    * And Kali linux ^^
